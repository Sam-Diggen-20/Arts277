<h2>“Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19” 
    </h2>
    
<p>As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be 
    feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard 
    down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected. <br> <br>
    Dr. Cardona explains. <br> <br>
    “‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best 
protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100% 
protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being 
exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”
<br> <br>

<h2>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, <br> 
    including other vaccinated people?</h2> <br> <br>
    
   <p> While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds 
that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines. <br><br>

“The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may 
not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data 
and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.” </p>
